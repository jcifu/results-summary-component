## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3 : Use of Flexbox and media queries for ensure responsive behavior

### What I learned

I got a better understanding of basic CSS commands and Flexbox. Media query is a easy way to get responsive changes on web components.  

### Continued development

The component requires to improve its responsive behavior for widths between 375 and 425 pixels. And it must include a hover button because in this version this feature wasn't completed. So, on future versions the component will add the hover and a basic Javascript integration.
